## Beautiful documentation

Material is a theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a fast and flexible static site generator. It is built using Google's [material design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)
guidelines, fully responsive, optimized for touch and pointer devices as well
as all sorts of screen sizes.

Material is very lightweight – it is built from scratch using Javascript and
CSS that weighs less than 30kb (minified, gzipped and excluding Google Fonts
and Analytics). Yet, it is highly customizable and degrades gracefully in older
browsers.

## Quick start

Install with `git`:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:digitalcraftsman/hugo-material-docs.git themes/hugo-material-docs
```

## Acknowledgements

Last but not least a big thank you to [Martin Donath](https://github.com/squidfunk). He created the original [Material theme](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) for Hugo's companion [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). This port wouldn't be possible without him.

Furthermore, thanks to [Steve Francia](https://gihub.com/spf13) for creating Hugo and the [awesome community](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/graphs/contributors) around the project.
